first open the code blocks project folder and add a new .txt file and name it "CMakeLists.txt"

in this .txt you have to write these lines between #### ####(while file_name=project_name and main.cpp is the main of your project) :

####

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(file_name)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

add_executable(file_name main.cpp)

####

and than open the project in cline as "open project" and find the folder named "file_name".
